    "In Python, @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators that define methods within a class, each serving distinct purposes:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "@staticmethod: Defines a method that doesn't access or modify the class state or instance state. It behaves like a regular function but resides within the class's namespace.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "@classmethod: Defines a method that receives the class itself as its first argument, typically named cls. This allows the method to access and modify class-level attributes.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to Class/Instance:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "@staticmethod: Lacks access to both class (cls) and instance (self) data.<br>\n",
    "@classmethod: Has access to the class object via cls, enabling modification of class state.<br>\n",
    "Use Cases:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "@staticmethod: Ideal for utility functions related to the class but not dependent on class or instance data.<br>\n",
    "@classmethod: Suitable for factory methods or methods that need to modify class-level attributes.<br>"

    "In Python, the __call__ method is a special dunder method that allows an instance of a class to be invoked as if it were a regular function. By implementing __call__, you enable your class instances to be called with parentheses, passing arguments just like a function call.<br>\n",
